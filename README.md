## What Is This?

Scream2Wish is a completely useless, mildly chaotic Android app that forces you to **scream as loud as you can** to break a genie's lamp — and only then lets you make a wish.

Your wish gets sent to the internet via a Cloudflare Worker → GitHub Actions pipeline and lives forever in a public repo. In return, you get to read a random stranger's note. Whether that's comforting or unsettling is entirely up to you.

It solves zero real-world problems. It does exactly what it says. That's the point.

## Download

[![Download APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20APK-Latest%20Release-ef4444?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Scream2Wish/releases/latest)

Install on any Android device (sideloading required — enable "Install from unknown sources" in settings).

## The Full Experience

### Step 1 — Permissions Gate
The app opens with an animated permission screen asking for microphone access (to detect your screams) and vibration (to annoy you while you're idle). You cannot proceed without granting both. The back button is "defective."

### Step 2 — Fake Login
A suspiciously serious login screen asks for your **real name** and a **password**. The name is used throughout the experience. The password has a specific validation rule — figure it out yourself. Enter it wrong enough times and a video overlay starts playing in the background to make you regret your life choices. A sound effect also plays. You have been warned.

### Step 3 — The Lamp
A countdown from 5. Then the main event.

A genie lamp sits in the center of the screen. A vertical amplitude meter in the top right corner reflects your scream in real time. **The louder you scream, the faster the lamp breaks.** Stop screaming for even a second and the lamp fully resets to normal. The phone vibrates at you constantly while you're silent — encouragement.

- **25% progress** — the lamp starts cracking. The genie speaks to you via text-to-speech.
- **55% progress** — the lamp is half destroyed.
- **100% progress** — the lamp shatters and one of three characters emerges:

| Value | Character | Probability |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `0` | 😈 Red Mermaid (yes, from a genie lamp) | 30% |
| `1` | 🧞 Genie | 35% |
| `2` | 🧜 Blue Mermaid (also from a genie lamp) | 35% |

### Step 4 — Make Your Wish
The character that emerged from the lamp greets you via text-to-speech and asks you to type your wish. Then it asks you to leave a note for the world. Both steps have a skip option, but after all that screaming, why would you?

### Step 5 — The End
Your wish and note are queued to be sent silently in the background to the [Scream2Wish-wishes](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Scream2Wish-wishes) repository. Meanwhile, you receive a random stranger's note in return — their name, their message, the timestamp of when they screamed. Below that, your own note is shown back to you. You can share your wish.

That's it. There is no restart button. The app is done with you.

### Why a Cloudflare Worker in the middle?

You cannot safely embed a GitHub token inside a mobile APK — it would be publicly extractable. The Cloudflare Worker holds the GitHub token securely as an environment secret. The app only needs a rotating API key to talk to the Worker, which is far easier to rotate without a new app release.

---

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, pnpm, an Android device (emulators won't work — no real mic metering)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Scream2Wish.git
cd Scream2Wish

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set environment variables
# Create a .env file:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_WISH_WORKER_URL=https://scream2wish.rajnishkmehta.workers.dev
# EXPO_PUBLIC_WISH_WORKER_API=your_api_key_here

# Start Expo dev server
npx expo start
```

To build a standalone APK:

```bash
# Requires EAS CLI and an Expo account
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

---

## Deploying the Worker

The Cloudflare Worker lives in `action-trigger-worker/`. It requires two environment secrets set in the Cloudflare dashboard:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A GitHub fine-grained token with `repo` write access to `Scream2Wish-wishes` |
| `API_KEY` | The API key the app uses to authenticate with the Worker |

```bash
cd action-trigger-worker
pnpm install
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Related Repos

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Scream2Wish](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Scream2Wish) | This repo — app + worker |
| [Scream2Wish-wishes](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Scream2Wish-wishes) | Public JSON store of all submitted wishes |

## Why Does This Exist?

The [DEV April Fools Challenge 2026](https://dev.to/challenges/aprilfools-2026) prompt was simple: build something completely useless or silly. Something that makes people ask *"why on earth did they build this?"*

The answer here is: because it required a scream-detection algorithm, a Cloudflare Worker, a GitHub Actions pipeline, three different characters (two of which are mermaids coming out of a lamp), text-to-speech, real-time vibration feedback, fake login validation, OTA updates, and a public wishes board all in service of letting someone type a wish into their phone.

It is overengineered on purpose. It is useless on purpose. And it absolutely works.
